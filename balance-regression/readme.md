# Linear Regression Using StatsModel

The code is well documented and speaks for itself more than I would like to here. Run the code like this:

```
mkdir output
python balance_predictor.py
```

Several reports will be generated. The reports are detailed in the code as well, but one will be an initial report containing information about the input data. The other 3 are residual or QQ plots. There are also generated text files, these files are the result of calling a StatsModel.ols.summary() and provide information relevant to the generated residual and QQ plots.
